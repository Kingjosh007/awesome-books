# Awesome Books
"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. By building this application through pair-programming, [Sohaib](https://github.com/sohaibya) and I strengthened our knowledge how to manage data using JavaScript. We used a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.
