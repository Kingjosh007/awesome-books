# Awesome Books

> "Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. By building this application through pair-programming, [Sohaib](https://github.com/sohaibya) and I strengthened our knowledge on how to manage data using JavaScript. That means dealing with objects, classes and localStorage. We used a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.

This project was divided into four (4) parts. Refer to the corresponding branch. The branch in bold is the one we are working on. 

1. Manage books collection (Plain JS with objects)
2. Manage books collection (Plain JS with classes)
3. Style core elements of the page
4. Complete website with navigation.
